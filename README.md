# CAMELS_data_sample
**Sample data** for running neural hydrology examples, and others. This is just to be able to EASILY learn to use the CAMELS data with whatever modeling platform you would like. This is not intended for any purpose other than learning to use the full data.

## Sample basins
I am including sample basins that fill out the directory structure of the origional CAMELS data from 2014. The streamflow and forcing files are in a directory structure that includes 01, 02, ..., 17 and 18. So I include one basin from each of those directories. This is just to make the data sizes smaller, so I can host on GitHub without a problem. The full data can be accessed from UCAR: https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels

## Sample years
I am including only years 1993 through 2013. This is just to make the data sizes smaller, so I can host on GitHub without a problem. The full data can be accessed from UCAR: https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels

## Citation guidelines
DO NOT CITE THIS. Please use the full CAMELS, or better yet, CARAVAN.
